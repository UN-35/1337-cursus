## üìú Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive portfolio of my journey through the 1337 School (part of the 42 Network) curriculum. It contains all the projects I've completed, showcasing my progression from basic C programming to complex system administration, networking, and full-stack development.

Each project is included as a submodule, representing a specific skill set or concept I've mastered through the rigorous "learn by doing" approach of the 42 pedagogy.

## üó∫Ô∏è Curriculum Map

The 1337/42 curriculum follows a branch-based learning path where projects become increasingly complex and specialized. Each completed project earns points that unlock new branches and challenges, allowing students to progress through the curriculum at their own pace.

The curriculum is divided into several circles of increasing difficulty:
- **Circle 1-2**: C programming fundamentals and basic algorithms
- **Circle 3-4**: Graphics, algorithms, and concurrent programming
- **Circle 5-6**: Advanced system concepts, networking, and web development
- **Final Projects**: Comprehensive full-stack applications

## üß± Foundation Projects (Circle 1-2)
